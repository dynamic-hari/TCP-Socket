# TCP-Socket
The basic idea is to create a server that listens on a particular port, this server will be responsible for receiving files (you can make the server sends files as well). On the other hand, the client will try to connect to the server and send a file of Text type. We can share the details of file so that client can choose which file have to be transferred.

Implemented Using Python!!
